#summary Notes on generating RDF from marked-up data.

= Introduction =

Big idea: we want to convert marked-up biodiversity literature into RDF in
such a way that:
  * We can write SPARQL queries against a database of RDF graphs that answer
useful questions for practioners, both within and across taxonomic scopes.
  * The meaning of the marked-up data is preserved in the RDF representation.


= Details =

We'll discuss here some issues that have come up in generating RDF and our 
solutions/thoughts for those issues.

== Motivating Example ==

Let's say we're dealing with the genus Sphairomeria.  There are about 8 species
in this genus.  Now let's say that a botanist wants to lookup the position
of the leaves for everything in this genus (and imagine that we have an RDF
graph that contains triples relating to only this genus).  So we have a 
structure, "leaf", a character "insertion_or_position", and optionally a 
modifier associated with each character-state value.

Now, when we first started producing RDF, we had some namespaces like
biosem:http://cs.umb.edu/biosemantics/

as toy examples, and we might have tried to express a triple about the 
leaf insertion/position of the species S. argentea as follows:

biosem:whole_organism	biosem:hasSubstructure	   biosem:structure#leaf
biosem:structure#leaf	biosem:character#leaf_insertion_or_position "cauline"

And is there's a modifier like "mostly" associated with this character-state,
we would just use reification on the second of these triples, with the 
predicate biosem:modifier and the object "mostly".  This isn't a terrible
representation of what we're going for, but in practice, one would quickly
find it to be inadequate.
